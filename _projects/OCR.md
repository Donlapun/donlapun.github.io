This project is a part of a NASA Astrophysics Data Analysis Program (ADAP) project aimed at creating several science-ready data products to help astronomersâ€™ search the literature in new ways.

I trained post-correction model to correct the images from OCR output. Additionally, I conduct statistical analysis to evaluate the performances of the model to find new approaches to improve the accuracy.

Below is the example of the output of after passed to different post-correction models.
