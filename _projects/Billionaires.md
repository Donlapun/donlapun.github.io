# Billionaire Status, Wealth Size, and Location from 1996-2014

In this project we will explore the Billionaire Dataset to find the meaning insights such as the association of different factors that might influence the wealth worth of the billionaires and shows in the visualizations as the findings with the writeup. The information about the dataset can be founded here: https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/csv/billionaires/

# Visualization 

## Interactive Visualization between the Line Graph of the Wealth Worth in Billions by Year Company Founded and the count of the Year Company Founded

#graphhh

The graph on the left is the line graph between the year company is founded in and the wealth worth in billions. 
The user can select the interval of the graph in order to see the histogram that shows the count of the year (in interval). 
We can see that there is an positive association between the year company is founded and the wealth worth in billions after 1500. 
The histogram shows the distribution of those years in more depth as it counts the how many companies are in each year. 
This helps us understand that even though there is an association between the year company is founded and the wealth worth in billions after 1500, 
the number of new companies that founded in each year does not have influence on the wealth worth in billions.
