# Privacy concerns among university students towards Learning Management System Data Collection

## Abstract

After the spread of COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, universities adjust their services in order to provide students to4 continue their studies virtually. One approach is to have a learning management system with courses available for students. In this project, we identify the data collected by the learning management system that third party vendors have access to as the challenge to online learning as well as its influence on studentsâ€™ concerns after the acknowledgement. We investigate each learning management that is currently at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign to create the list of data being collected and gather the information from the university students by using surveys to reflect their concerns. The outcomes present the individual feeling indifferent despite learning new information from the privacy policy.
