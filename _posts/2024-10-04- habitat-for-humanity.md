# Habitat for Humanity Student Chapter
I have been working with Habitat for Humanity (H4H) since 2021 as Dorm Ambassador and the Habitat Buddies. However, I decided to work as the concession chair which is in the fundraising committee in 2022. In the 2023-2024 academc year, I worked as secreary for the student executive committee.

# Concession 
What we do in concession for H4H? We basically run the food stand in the sport games such as football or basketball for 6-8 hours and all the compensation goes toward funding the house of the local family. 

In FALL 2022, we had a total of 5 concessions which makes more than $6,000. As the concession chair, I manage volunteers, contact the stand staff, and run the concession as stand managers. It is always fun to work with new people, learn new things, and is able to gives back to the communities. Let's take a look at some picture and video from the concessions.

# Secretary
As the secretary, I managed the organiation archive, google calendar, space reservation. Additionally, I also participate in the weekly executive meeting and maintain the H4H officer requirements.


There are other events that people can participate in H4H as well and you don't have to become officers to do so! This includes build the house for the family, promote h4H events, and signature events for fundraising!
