## My Role in PHM
Current position: Education Director
FALL 2022: Education Chair
SPRING 2022: Active Member

As the education director of PHM my responsibilities is to organize the professional workshops such as resume reviews, and the study sessions that hold twice a week. Furthermore, I also arrange the speaker sessions, professors and companies, with secretary. Besides these events, I am also responsible to maintain the PHM overall GPA to be at least 3.0 as well as update documents for all current jobs, internship, research opportunities.

## Social Life 
Even though the fraternity focuses on personal professional development, we also make sure that the member create life-long relationships through their time in the organization, for example: semi-formal winter dance, game night, boba event, etc.
