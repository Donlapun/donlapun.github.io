## My Role in PHM


## 3. A third thing

We are now getting into the weeds of things that I am saying.  It is probably unlikely someone has made it thus far.

## 4. Thing #4.

At this point, you are probably no longer into me listing off things.  Let's put in an image to placate the reader:

## 5. The last thing

This is my final thing, probably would be great if this was a TL;DR or summary.  But I don't have that for you.  I have given you so little already, why start saying anything useful now?

Besides, all anybody wants is the DERP:
